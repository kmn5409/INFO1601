    <h2>Safety Precautions Before a Tsunami</h2>
        <p>When in coastal areas, stay alert for tsunami warnings.</p>
        <p>Check your disaster supplies kit. Make sure you have water, non-perishable food, medications and don't forget that non-electric can opener.</p>
        <p>If you are a tourist, familiarize yourself with local tsunami evacuation protocols. If you are concerned that you will not be able to reach a safe place in time, ask your local emergency management office about vertical evacuation. Some strong (e.g., reinforced concrete) and tall buildings may be able to provide protection if no other options are available.
            If an earthquake occurs and you are in a coastal area, turn on your radio to learn if there is a tsunami warning.</p>

    <h2>Safety Precautions During a Tsunami</h2>
        <p>Follow the evacuation order issued by authorities and evacuate immediately. Take your animals with you.</p>
        <p>Stay away from the beach. Never go down to the beach to watch a tsunami come in. If you can see the wave you are too close to escape it. CAUTION - If there is noticeable recession in water away from the shoreline this is nature's tsunami warning and it should be heeded. You should move away immediately.</p>
        <p>Save yourself - not your possessions.</p>

    <h2>Safety Precautions After a Tsunami</h2>
        <p>Return home only after local officials tell you it is safe. A tsunami is a series of waves that may continue for hours. Do not assume that after one wave the danger is over. The next wave may be larger than the first one.</p>
        <p>Avoid disaster areas. Your presence might interfere with emergency response operations and put you at further risk from the residual effects of floods.</p>
        <p>Help people who require special assistanceâ€”infants, elderly people, those without transportation, people with access and functional needs and large families who may need additional help in an emergency situation.</p>
