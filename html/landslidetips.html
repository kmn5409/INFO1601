            <h2>Safety Precautions Before a LandSlide</h2>
                <p>To begin preparing, you should build an emergency kit and make a family communications plan.</p>
                <p>In mudflow areas, build channels or deflection walls to direct the flow around buildings. Be aware, however, if you build walls to divert debris flow and the flow lands on a neighbor's property, you may be liable for damages.</p>
                <p>Become familiar with the land around you. Learn whether debris flows have occurred in your area by contacting local officials. Slopes where debris flows have occurred in the past are likely to experience them in the future.</p>

            <h2>Safety Precautions During a LandSlide</h2>
            <p>Move away from the path of a landslide or debris flow as quickly as possible. The danger from a mudflow increases near stream channels and with prolonged heavy rains. Mudflows can move faster than you can walk or run. Look upstream before crossing a bridge and do not cross the bridge if a mudflow is approaching.
                Avoid river valleys and low-lying areas.</p>
            <p>Curl into a tight ball and protect your head if escape is not possible.</p>
            <p>If you are near a stream or channel, be alert for any sudden increase or decrease in water flow and notice whether the water changes from clear to muddy. Such changes may mean there is debris flow activity upstream so be prepared to move quickly.</p>

            <h2>Safety Precautions After a LandSlide</h2>
            <p>Go to a designated public shelter if you have been told to evacuate or you feel it is unsafe to remain in your home. Text SHELTER + your ZIP code to 43362 (4FEMA) to find the nearest shelter in your area</p>
            <p>Watch for flooding, which may occur after a landslide or debris flow. Floods sometimes follow landslides and debris flows because they may both be started by the same event.</p>
            <p>Check the building foundation, chimney, and surrounding land for damage. Damage to foundations, chimneys, or surrounding land may help you assess the safety of the area.</p>
